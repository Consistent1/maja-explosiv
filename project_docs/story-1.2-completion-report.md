## Next Steps

**Story 1.3: Script and Execute Content Migration**

Now that the content structure is in place, the next story will:
1. Extract content from TYPO3 SQL database
2. Convert to Markdown files
3. Populate the structure created in this story
4. Replace placeholder content with actual migrated content

**Preparation for Story 1.3:**
- Content structure is ready to receive migrated data
- Asset directories are organized and ready for images
- Naming conventions are documented
- Build system is verified and working

---

## Notes

- **Override System:** Successfully using `src/_user/` directories for site-specific customizations
- **Asset Organization:** Following approved strategy (category → series → images)
- **Placeholder Images:** Color-coded for easy identification during development
- **Build Performance:** Fast build times (~10 seconds) indicate good performance
- **No Template Changes:** All work done in user override directories as planned

---

## Developer Notes

The implementation went smoothly with no issues. The template's override system worked perfectly, allowing us to customize without modifying base template files. The asset organization strategy is in place and ready for the migration in Story 1.3.

**Server is currently running at:** http://localhost:8080/

You can browse the placeholder structure to verify everything is working correctly.
