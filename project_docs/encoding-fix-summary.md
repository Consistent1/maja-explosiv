# Character Encoding Fix - Summary Report

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Issue:** Double-encoded UTF-8 in TYPO3 SQL dump  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem

German characters (umlauts) and special characters were corrupted in the extracted content:

- "Käthe" appeared as "KÃ¤the"
- "Zürich" appeared as "ZÃ¼rich"
- "Luginbühl" appeared as "LuginbÃ¼hl"

## Root Cause

The SQL file (`old/usr_p51487_2.sql`) contains **double-encoded UTF-8** text:

1. Original text was UTF-8 encoded: 'ä' → bytes `c3a4`
2. These bytes were misinterpreted as Latin-1: `c3a4` → 'Ã¤' (two characters)
3. Then re-encoded as UTF-8: 'Ã¤' → bytes `c383c2a4`
4. Result: "Käthe" stored as bytes `4b c383c2a4 746865` in SQL file

## Solution

**Reverse the double-encoding during text extraction:**

```python
def fix_double_encoding(text):
    """Fix double-encoded UTF-8 text"""
    if not text:
        return ""
    
    try:
        # Reverse the double-encoding: encode as Latin-1, decode as UTF-8
        return text.encode('latin1').decode('utf-8')
    except (UnicodeDecodeError, UnicodeEncodeError):
        # If fix fails, return original text
        return text
```

**How it works:**

1. Read SQL file as UTF-8: gives us "KÃ¤the" (double-encoded)
2. Encode as Latin-1: converts 'Ã¤' back to bytes `c3a4`
3. Decode as UTF-8: interprets `c3a4` correctly as 'ä'
4. Result: "Käthe" ✓

## Implementation

**Files Modified:**

1. **`scripts/extract_typo3_projects.py`:**
   - Changed SQL file reading from `encoding='latin1'` to `encoding='utf-8'` (2 locations)
   - Added `fix_double_encoding()` function
   - Applied fix to:
     - Page titles (line 179)
     - Content headers (line 258)
     - Content body text (line 261)
     - All text in `clean_html()` function (line 332)

## Verification

**Test Results:**

```bash
# Before fix:
Title: "KÃ¤the"
Description: "...in ZÃ¼rich..."

# After fix:
Title: "Käthe"
Description: "...in Zürich..."
Slug: "kathe.md"
```

**Build Results:**
- ✅ All 70 projects extracted successfully
- ✅ No encoding errors or exceptions
- ✅ Build succeeds: `npm run build` → 55 files
- ✅ German characters display correctly in all files

## Examples of Fixed Text

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| KÃ¤the | Käthe |
| ZÃ¼rich | Zürich |
| LuginbÃ¼hl | Luginbühl |
| UnterfÃ¼hrung | Unterführung |
| PfÃ¤ffikon | Pfäffikon |

## Technical Details

**Why this approach?**

1. **Safe:** Doesn't assume entire SQL file is one encoding
2. **Targeted:** Fixes only text fields, not SQL structure
3. **Robust:** Has error handling for edge cases
4. **Early:** Fixes at extraction phase (as requested)

**Error Handling:**

- Try/except catches encoding/decoding failures
- Returns original text if fix fails
- Prevents crashes on unexpected data

**Performance:**

- Minimal overhead (encode + decode are fast operations)
- Applied only to text fields, not entire file
- No noticeable impact on extraction time

## Files Affected

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/extract_typo3_projects.py` - Modified

**Data:**
- `project_docs/extracted-projects.json` - Regenerated with correct encoding
- `src/posts/projects/sculptures/kathe.md` - Created with correct title
- `src/posts/projects/sculptures/ka-a-the.md` - Removed (old corrupted version)

**Documentation:**
- `project_docs/typo3-technical-findings.md` - Updated with encoding details
- `project_docs/encoding-fix-summary.md` - This document

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Encoding fix complete and verified
2. ⏭️ Continue with image extraction
3. ⏭️ Convert remaining 50 projects
4. ⏭️ Full migration and testing

**Resolution:** The double-encoding issue has been successfully resolved. All German characters and special characters now display correctly in the extracted content.
