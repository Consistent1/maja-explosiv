## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Character Encoding Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- German characters corrupted: "K√É¬§the" instead of "K√§the"
- "Z√É¬ºrich" instead of "Z√ºrich"

**Root Cause:**
- SQL file contains double-encoded UTF-8
- UTF-8 bytes misinterpreted as Latin-1, then re-encoded as UTF-8

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `fix_double_encoding()` function
- Applied fix during extraction phase (as requested)
- Modified `scripts/extract_typo3_projects.py`:
  - Changed SQL reading from `encoding='latin1'` to `encoding='utf-8'`
  - Added encoding fix to all text fields (titles, headers, body text)

**Verification:**
- ‚úÖ All 70 projects extracted without encoding errors
- ‚úÖ German characters display correctly
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds: `npm run build` ‚Üí 55 files
- ‚úÖ No UnicodeDecodeError exceptions

**Documentation:**
- `project_docs/encoding-fix-summary.md` - Detailed summary
- `project_docs/typo3-technical-findings.md` - Updated with fix details

### 2. Missing Project Investigation - IN PROGRESS üîç

**Problem Discovered:**
- User reported 8 projects in paintings category (3 murals + 5 paper work)
- Extraction script only found 7 projects
- Missing: "Breath under Water" (UID 982)

**Investigation Results:**

‚úÖ **Page exists in database:**
- UID: 982
- PID: 875 (paper work category)
- Title: "Breath under Water"
- Deleted: 0 (NOT deleted)
- Hidden: 0 (NOT hidden)

‚ùå **Content missing from tt_content table:**
- 0 tt_content records with pid=982
- Script correctly skips pages without content
- This is why it's not extracted

‚úÖ **Evidence of content existence:**
- Found cached HTML page in database (cache_pages table)
- Page contains extensive content about whale sculpture project
- Multiple images, detailed description, video references
- Appears to be large mechanical art installation

**Current Count:**
- Murals (PID 874): 3 projects ‚úì
- Paper Work (PID 875): 4 projects extracted (5 pages exist)
  - Graphical Work (UID 920) ‚úì
  - Akwa (UID 921) ‚úì
  - Malaga la Vache (UID 922) ‚úì
  - Concept Illustration (UID 923) ‚úì
  - **Breath under Water (UID 982) ‚úó - NO CONTENT IN tt_content**
- **Total: 7 projects (not 8)**

**Status:** PAUSED - Awaiting investigation

### 3. Documentation Updates

**Created:**
- `project_docs/encoding-fix-summary.md` - Encoding fix summary
- `project_docs/SESSION-2025-10-29-SUMMARY.md` - This file

**Updated:**
- `project_docs/typo3-technical-findings.md`:
  - Added encoding fix details
  - Added missing project investigation
  - Added "How to Resume This Work" section
  - Updated Known Issues section

**Data Files:**
- `project_docs/extracted-projects.json` - Regenerated with correct encoding

**Content Files:**
- Created: `src/posts/projects/sculptures/kathe.md` (correct encoding)
- Removed: `src/posts/projects/sculptures/ka-a-the.md` (old corrupted version)

## What Needs to Be Done Next

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Investigate Missing Project

**User's Request:**
> "I would like to proceed with investigating the DB (option A) but I think this should be done by cross-referencing it with info from the website (option D)."

**Action Items:**

1. **Cross-reference with website files (Option D):**
   - Check `old/` directory for actual website files
   - Look for content in fileadmin or other directories
   - Search for "breath", "whale", or related terms
   - Compare with cached HTML to find source

2. **Investigate other database tables (Option A):**
   - Check for extension-specific content tables
   - Look for plugin data storage
   - Search for UID 982 references in other tables
   - Determine if content stored elsewhere

3. **Categorization question:**
   - Is "Breath under Water" actually a painting/paper work?
   - Description mentions "whale sculpture" and "mechanical spectacle"
   - Might belong in different category (installations? sculptures? performance?)

4. **Decision:**
   - Should this project be included in migration?
   - If yes, where should content come from?
   - If no, document why it's excluded

### AFTER INVESTIGATION

1. **Image Extraction**
2. **Full Migration** (remaining 50 or 49 projects)
3. **Content Cleanup**
4. **Testing and Verification**

## How to Resume Work

### Step 1: Review Context

Read these files in order:

1. **`project_docs/SESSION-2025-10-29-SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Quick overview of what was done
   - What needs to be done next

2. **`project_docs/typo3-technical-findings.md`**
   - Complete technical documentation
   - All findings and solutions
   - "How to Resume This Work" section (lines 760-859)

3. **`project_docs/encoding-fix-summary.md`**
   - Details of encoding fix
   - Before/after examples

### Step 2: Verify Current State

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/miichael/Code/maja-explosiv

# Verify build works
npm run build
# Expected: Success, 55 files generated

# Check extracted data
cat project_docs/extracted-projects.json | jq '.paintings | length'
# Expected: 7 (not 8)

# Verify encoding fix
grep -a "K√§the" src/posts/projects/sculptures/kathe.md
# Expected: Should show "K√§the" correctly, not "K√É¬§the"
```

### Step 3: Investigate Missing Project

**Option D - Check website files:**

```bash
# Search for "breath" or "whale" in old files
find old/ -type f -name "*breath*" -o -name "*whale*" 2>/dev/null

# Check image directories
ls -la old/fileadmin/s-maj/images/BilderMaja/ | grep -i whale
ls -la old/fileadmin/s-maj/images/BilderMaja/ | grep -i breath

# Search file contents
grep -r "Breath under Water" old/ 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

**Option A - Check database:**

```bash
# Search for UID 982 in other tables
grep -a "982" old/usr_p51487_2.sql | grep -v "INSERT INTO \`pages\`" | head -20

# Look for extension tables
grep -a "CREATE TABLE" old/usr_p51487_2.sql | grep -i plugin
grep -a "CREATE TABLE" old/usr_p51487_2.sql | grep -i content
```

### Step 4: Make Decision

Based on investigation results:

1. **If content found:**
   - Determine how to extract it
   - Update extraction script if needed
   - Re-run extraction

2. **If content not found:**
   - Document why project is excluded
   - Update count to 7 projects (not 8)
   - Proceed with remaining work

### Step 5: Continue Migration

Once investigation complete:

```bash
# Re-run extraction if needed
python3 scripts/extract_typo3_projects.py

# Convert all projects (not just test 20)
python3 scripts/convert_test_projects.py --all  # (may need to add --all flag)

# Verify build
npm run build

# Check results
find src/posts/projects -name "*.md" | wc -l
```
