Starting in early 2020, a band of five monkeys have been realized since. The first three monkeys could be installed in their home in Zürich in June 2021, the monkeys four and five were installed in September 2022.The sculptures are formed from 4mm and 6mm round steel pieces, then welded and grinded.
In July 2020, the first two monkeys could participate in the  group exhibition Lauschen
statt Rauschen in Galerie Neurotitan, which was organized in celebration of the 25 years
anniversary of the Haus Schwarzenberg in Berlin Mitte.

8.5 by 3.0 m metal drawing  Hinwil, for the new building of the Swiss Raiffeisen Bank in 
the town Hinwil.
The search of the requested  local connection for the art work, cristalized in these two 
worlds: the Bachtel mountain and the 'Räderwerk', the wheel work.
The Bachtel is the mountain, which, striking and unmistakable, towers over the town of Hinwil.
In its character it is impressive,  friendly and above all it is natural. In stark contrast to this, 
the immense industrial area of Hinwil is stretching out on the plain in front of the town.
I tried to capture these two opposites: the Bachtel with the historic village that nestles on 
its feet, and the associated, pulsating and non-stop value-creating  industrial zone. 
The Bachtel and the technology, the nature and the industry. 
Side by side and together, fast and slow, quiet and hectic.
In the middle they overlap. And together they form a great tension-filled unity.
And in this duality they are, for me, a symbol for the community of Hinwil.
 
The vast metal drawing was realized in the Atelier Thommen & Moss, in collaboration with: 
Uri Moss /IL, Frank Barnes /GB, Jens Schendel /D, Jakob Fliszar/D, Steve Studinski /D, 
Gaby Wiegelmann /D, Manfred Springer /D and Grex Portmann /CH
