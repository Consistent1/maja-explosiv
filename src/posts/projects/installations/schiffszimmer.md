Overall design of one hotel rooms for a guest- and seminar house, including a metal scenery, 
drawn to the wall. As the guesthouse is located in the former apprentice house of the shipyard 
Rechlin, I chose the  iron image or wire drawing to be a harbor scene with a lifeboat, which is 
 reminiscent of the lifeboats that were built in this shipyard, located  on the Müritz lake.

The stairs, the railing on the loft bed and the single bed are realized from recycled teak wood. 
These precious planks have been salvaged from a 100-year-old shipwreck, sunken in the port 
of Hamburg.
Realisation with Babu Fuhrer (CH) and Uri Moss (CH) in our Atelier in Berlin and installed on 
location in Mai 2022.
The seminar house Kulturkosmos is located in the beautiful region of Müritz, next to the Fusion 
Festival site, North Germany.
