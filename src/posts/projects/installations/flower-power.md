The 'Lazy Suzanâ€˜s' are two round shelves mounted at the bar counter to hold the mixing bottles for the 
bar keepers. These two stands were designed and  commissioned by the Karaoke Bar Monster Ronson's 
Ichiban Karaoke in Berlin Friedrichshain.
The flower bouquets are designed to be a protection and yet a decoration for the liqueur shelves.
Each bouquet holds about 70 flowers and in total we worked over 1800 singular pieces of cutlery into the 
two bouquets.
This stainless steel installation was created together with Uri Moss IL/D and Charly F/D, from all kind of 
silverware like spoons, forks and knives but also embedded microphones, due to the topic 
of the bar.
The Lazy Suzanâ€˜s and the flower bouquets were realized in our Berlin atelier over the Summer and Autumn 
Months of 2019.
