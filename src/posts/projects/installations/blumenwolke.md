'Die Blumenwolke', or the Cloud of Flowers, is a chandelier realized from over 280 flowers, 
which are made from recycled cutlery. In total I estimate to have used around 3000 singular pieces of 
silverware, like spoons, forks and knives, tea eggs etc.
The custom designed  chandelier lights the big dining table with two down lamps and throws
ambient light via LED Strips to the ceiling. The lamps are switch- and dimmable individually.
For the flower arrangement we had the inspiring input of the floral designer Leighton Cheal /GB
The flowers and the stainless steel installation were created together with Uri Moss /IL and 
Charly /F.
'Die Blumenwolke' was realized in our Berlin atelier over the Winter and Spring Months of 2021
and is now installed in the home it was designed for in Switzerland.
