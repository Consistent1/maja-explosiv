Starting in early 2020, a band of five monkeys have been realized since. The first three monkeys could be installed in their home in Zürich in June 2021, the monkeys four and five were installed in September 2022.The sculptures are formed from 4mm and 6mm round steel pieces, then welded and grinded.
In July 2020, the first two monkeys could participate in the  group exhibition Lauschen
statt Rauschen in Galerie Neurotitan, which was organized in celebration of the 25 years
anniversary of the Haus Schwarzenberg in Berlin Mitte.

4.5 by 2.0m wall sculpture for the dining room of the Kulturkosmos guesthouse, Fusion 
Festival, Lärz, MV. 
The inspiration for the harbor scene is based on the history of the house, which was built 
as an apprentice house for the Rechlin shipyard. 
The drawing also refers to the ship's room, das Schiffszimmer, where a different, smaller 
view of the cranes is depicted. And which we could decorate and furnish for the guesthouse 
in 2022. 
The metal drawing was realized in the Atelier Thommen & Moss in Berlin and could be  
installed in Lärz in May 2024
