Concept and design of the main gate for the Sisyphos Club.

The gateway with the two slightly three dimensional kissing ducks spans over 6 by 6 meters. In the ribbon above the gate five DMX controlled propan gas flamethrowers are incorporated.

Realization of the precision metalwork on site in great teamwork with:
- Horst Steel /D
- KAI /D
- Erico Moreira /BRA
- Uri Moss /IL

The fire installation was realized by Eddie Egal /D

August 2013, Berlin, Germany
