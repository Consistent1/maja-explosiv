The monkey gang, is an overall sculpture concept for a private house in Zürich. In total
seven monkeys are projected to be climbing over the steel annex of the residence by end 
of the year 2024. 

Starting in early 2020, until now a band of five monkeys have been realized since. 
The first three monkeys could be installed in their home in Zürich in June 2021, the monkeys 
four and five were installed in September 2022.
The sculptures are formed from 4mm and 6mm round steel pieces, then welded and grinded.
In July 2020, the first two monkeys could participate in the  group exhibition Lauschen
statt Rauschen in Galerie Neurotitan, which was organized in celebration of the 25 years
anniversary of the Haus Schwarzenberg in Berlin Mitte. 
The steel annex of the living house is another XIX metal group project:
Grex Portmann made the concept and design of the bridges, the rails and the spiral stair case, 
while Maja Thommen was in charge of the monkey gang climbing on the construction.
