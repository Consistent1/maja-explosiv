The dragon-like sculpture was realised onsite for the 'Off the Radar' Festival in Te Arai, 
New Zealand, January 2014.

The sculpture, mainly built from recycled car parts, reached an overall length of 17 meters; 
the main body was built onto two swimming platforms, one for the head and one for the rear 
part of the body, followed by a little tale fluke. 

For the night performance the sea monster was manually maneuvered over the lake, where itÂ  
spit fire, fortified by different water effects like water jets, water shields, and underwater 
eruptions.
The two main platforms were engineered to dive and emerge separately, each based upon three 
industrial water tanks. The flooding and emptying of each tank could be controlled individually, 
and so the result was quite a vivid performance.

Concept development with Elias Macke and Hannes Jung

Realisation together with Herbz aka Rah Creations /AUS, Babu Fuhrer /CH, Fabi Bodmer /CH, 
Muriel Gutherz /CH, Rebell /CH, Elias Macke /D, and Hannes Jung Irl/D.

This project was facilitated thanks to the outstanding support of the Wellsford Towing 
and Salvage LTD, as well as Freds Metal Recycling.
