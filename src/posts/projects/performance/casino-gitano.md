In good old gypsy ways Casino Gitano feed from the vast reservoir of the European Folk-
Music tradition without any inhibition, from orthodox flamenco to Tango, Swing, Chansons, 
or Folklore. 
The colourful show forms around the tap dancing twin sisters Carmen and Christina Rodriguez, 
the Spanish singer Ivana Quiles, the French singer Thierry Fantaisie, rounded up by the old 
Serbian flamenco master Lubi Kimpanov. 
Further more: Pancho on the guitar, Tonjo Gonzales on the cajon, Pablo Luzanda on the 
Contrabass, a Swedish and a German violin, Juanita and Charlot, Maja la maja on the recorder, 
Franco Negro the tuba and the Serbian trumpeter Vedran.

Due to the new EU law about data protection, i had to take all the videos down. Until I find a 
better solution, you can watch the videos of my projects on my YouTube channel:
