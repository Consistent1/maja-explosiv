Maja Thommen was a founding member of Elxt 90, which consisted of a core group 
of four Swiss girls. At that time the project was called Misfire and the show centred around 
a six meter rotating wheel from which physical stunts and pyrotechnic feats were performed.
Misfireâ€™s debut performance took place at Jim Whitingâ€™s Bimbo Town in Leipzig, Germany.

After a chance meeting with fire artists from Berlinâ€™s BÃ¼ro fÃ¼r brenzlige Angelegenheiten 
in 2000, the two groups combined their talents and the show began it's next chapter and 
was brought into a new realm of possibilities with their fire feats.

From 2001 till 2003, Elxt 90â€™s dynamic circus project, grand-scale fire and acrobatic show 
grew continuously bigger, more international and professional. The final shows featured 
nearly 20 performance artists, painters, musicians, and technicians.

During this time Elxt 90 became a full-time project for M. Thommen as she was tasked with 
organisation, fundraising and an annual two-month preparation period for the show's new 
concepts and acts.

Due to the new EU law about data protection, i had to take all the videos down. Until I find a 
better solution, you can watch the videos of my projects on my YouTube channel:
