Partnered with Mark Divo, Maja helped lead the conception, organisation and coordination 
of this multimedia event.
Taking place in the vacant pedestrian underpass Escher-Wyss evolves an overall artwork 
from large-scale paintings, sculptural objects, sound installations. Most notably, the show 
was made entirely with recycled material.
The project is supported by the government of the city of Zurich, the city waste company 
and pro Helvetia. (Präsidialabteilung der Stadt Zürich, Abfuhrwesen der Stadt Zürich, 
pro Helvetia, Kulturaustausch Ost/West)
Thirty international artists were invited to manipulate during the three-week build up phase 
over twenty tons of waist material.
