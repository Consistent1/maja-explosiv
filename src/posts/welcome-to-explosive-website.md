# Welcome to the Explosive Website Template!

We're thrilled to introduce our brand new **Explosive Website Template** - a powerful, flexible, and modern solution for building static websites with 11ty (Eleventy).

## What Makes It Special?

This template has been designed from the ground up to solve common challenges developers face when building content-rich websites:

### ðŸŽ¯ Flexible Content Organization

Unlike traditional blog templates, Explosive Website supports multiple content types:

- **Static Pages**: Perfect for about pages, contact forms, and landing pages
- **Blog Posts**: Full-featured articles with rich metadata
- **Collections**: Organize content into themed groups that can be nested and cross-referenced

### ðŸ“± Mobile-First Design

Every component has been crafted with mobile users in mind:

```css
/* Example of our responsive approach */
.post-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  gap: 2rem;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .post-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .post-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
}
```

### âš¡ Performance Optimized

Built for speed:

- Static site generation for instant loading
- Optimized images with lazy loading
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Clean, semantic HTML

## Getting Started

Setting up your new website is incredibly simple:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/explosive/website-template.git
   cd website-template
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start developing**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

That's it! Your development server will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Navigation

The navigation system automatically includes:
- Static pages (configurable)
- Collection overviews
- Custom links
- Responsive mobile menu

### Rich Content Support

Posts support a wide range of content types:

- **Text content** with full Markdown support
- **Images** with captions and alt text
- **Media galleries** for multiple images or videos
- **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting
- **Custom metadata** for SEO and social sharing

### Collection System

The collection system is where this template really shines:

```yaml
---
collections: [tutorials, web-development]
tags: [javascript, css, html]
---
```

Posts can belong to multiple collections, and collections can be nested within each other, creating a powerful content organization system.

## What's Next?

We have exciting plans for future updates:

- [ ] Built-in search functionality
