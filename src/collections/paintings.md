title: Paintings
description: Two-dimensional explorations in color, texture, and composition that complement the three-dimensional work. These paintings range from gestural abstractions to more structured compositions, often incorporating mixed media and experimental techniques. Each piece investigates the relationship between surface and depth, using layering and mark-making to create complex visual narratives.
