title: Performance
description: Documentation of live art performances that blur the boundaries between sculpture, theater, and ritual. These works explore the body as material and the ephemeral nature of action-based art. Through carefully choreographed gestures and interactions with objects, each performance creates temporary moments of transformation that exist only in memory and photographic record.
