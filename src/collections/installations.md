title: Installations
description: Site-specific works that transform spaces through the careful arrangement of materials, light, and sculptural elements. These installations create immersive environments that engage viewers physically and emotionally. Each piece responds to its architectural context while exploring themes of memory, transformation, and the passage of time through thoughtfully composed spatial interventions.
